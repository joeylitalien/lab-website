% Define venue/journal string here and reuse in your bib entries for
% consistency. I include a list of many of the venues I often cite below.
% There are several reasons for doing this:
%
% Consistency: many online sources list the same venues slightly differently.
%
% History: Many journals/conferences have complicated histories. Some
% conferences change name (e.g., the rendering workshop turning into the
% rendering symposium), they also change the way they are published (e.g.,
% starting in 2008 EGSR is published in the journal Computer Graphics Forum).
%
% Define a string eliminates the need to remember the exact cutoffs and names.

    abstract = {We describe a machine learning technique for reconstructing image sequences rendered using Monte Carlo methods. Our primary focus is on reconstruction of global illumination with extremely low sampling budgets at interactive rates. Motivated by recent advances in image restoration with deep convolutional networks, we propose a variant of these networks better suited to the class of noise present in Monte Carlo rendering. We allow for much larger pixel neighborhoods to be taken into account, while also improving execution speed by an order of magnitude. Our primary contribution is the addition of recurrent connections to the network in order to drastically improve temporal stability for sequences of sparsely sampled input images. Our method also has the desirable property of automatically modeling relationships based on auxiliary per-pixel input channels, such as depth and normals. We show signi cantly higher quality results compared to existing methods that run at comparable speeds, and furthermore argue a clear path for making our method run at realtime rates in the near future.},

We derive Fourier spectra for radiance and importance functions that allow us to compute spatial-angular filtering footprints at path vertices, for both uni- and bi-directional path construction. We then use these footprints to antialias reflectance modulated by high-resolution maps (such as color and normal maps) encountered along a path. In doing so, we also unify the traditional path-space formulation of light-transport with our frequency-space interpretation of global illumination pre-filtering. Our method is fully compatible with all existing single bounce pre-filtering appearance models, not restricted by path length, and easy to implement atop existing path-space renderers. We illustrate its effectiveness on several radiometrically complex scenarios where previous approaches either completely fail or require orders of magnitude more time to arrive at similarly high-quality results.},
